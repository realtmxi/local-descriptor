The historgram of oriented gradients(HOG) is a feature desciptor used in computer vision and image processing for the purpsoe of object detection.

The technique counts occurrences of gradient orientation in localized portions of an image.

This method is similar to that of SIFT descriptors, and shape contexts.

Until deep learning, HOG was one of the long-standing top representations for object detection.



I implement a variant of HOG. Given an input image, my algorithm will compute the HOG feature and visualize it.
